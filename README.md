# What is image name and How to cal it

For example, images are built for a cool Web application Nitrate

Image repository in a registry: nitrate

Namespace in the registry: namespace. In some registry, it is called organization alternatively.

Let's user Quay.io as the registry.

Image name: quay.io/namespace/nitrate

Image tag: v0.1, v0.2

Full image name: quay.io/user/nitrate:v0.1

When say "image", which does it mean, the image name or the full image name.

**Recommendation**: ?

It would be good separate the context, talking about images generally or specific to image registries.
